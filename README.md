This is the ubuntu 18 compatible source code of Hyp-DESPOT-ALPHA algorithm published in RSS 2019 paper:

Neha Priyadarshini Garg, David Hsu, Wee Sun Lee : DESPOT-Alpha: Online POMDP Planning with Large State and Observation Spaces. Robotics: Science & Systems XV 2019  [PDF](http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss15/p06.pdf).

The original code was tested on ubuntu 16 with cuda 9 with GTX1080 GPUs. See [here](https://github.com/nehagarg/hyp-despot-alpha-dev/tree/HyP-Despot-LargeObservation-Without-Grasping) for instructions on how to compile and run the code. The ubuntu 18 version has not been tested.
